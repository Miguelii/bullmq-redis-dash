# ðŸŽ¯ QueueDash

A simple and educational demo showcasing how to manage background tasks using [BullMQ](https://docs.bullmq.io/), [Redis](https://redis.io/), and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

This application demonstrates how to offload long or intensive processes (like sending emails, processing files, or performing heavy computations) to background jobs using a queue system.
