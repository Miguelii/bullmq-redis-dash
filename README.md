## ðŸ“˜ About the Project

**Campaign Queue Dash** simulates a basic SaaS platform that any team could use to automate and monitor operational tasks.

This demo focuses on queue-based processing to handle events like mass email dispatches, volunteer coordination, and scheduled posts â€” all without blocking the main application.

Itâ€™s a great starting point for developers looking to showcase their skills in asynchronous task handling, queues, and real-world application structure.
